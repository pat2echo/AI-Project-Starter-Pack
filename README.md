# AI-Project-Starter-Pack
The AI Project Starter Pack is a meticulously structured directory and module framework designed for creating machine learning and data science projects. This starter pack aims to streamline the project setup process, helping data scientists and developers organize their code, data, and documentation efficiently. 


# Output: Project Directory Structure

## `name_of_package/`
This is the main package directory where the core functionalities of your project reside. It is organized into several subdirectories each catering to specific needs:

### `data/`
- **`loader.py`**: Modules for data loading.
- **`preprocess.py`**: Modules for data preprocessing.

### `features/`
- **`builder.py`**: Code for feature engineering and transformations.

### `ml_models/`
- **`train_model.py`**: Houses model training scripts.
- **`predict_model.py`**: Contains prediction scripts.

### `utils/`
- **`helpers.py`**: Comprises utility functions which can be used across the project.

### `visualization/`
- **`visualize.py`**: Dedicated to visualization functions that help in plotting and data interpretation.

## `notebooks/`
Contains Jupyter notebooks for various stages of the project, including:
- Exploratory data analysis.
- Feature engineering.
- Model training.
- Model evaluation.
- Explainable AI insights.

## `backup_notebooks/`
Stores backup copies of notebooks, ensuring data recovery and version control.

## `tests/`
Includes a test suite with scripts designed to test:
- Data handling.
- Feature engineering.
- Model functionality.

## `setup.py`
A setup script for installing the project as a package.

## `requirements.txt`
Lists all project dependencies, ensuring reproducibility.

## `README.md`
Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and additional documentation.
